Hi there, I'm Dinh, a software engineer specializing in creating custom websites and web applications for small businesses and startups. With over four years of experience, I have expertise in frontend, backend, and DevOps, and skills in Nodejs, React, and Dotnet.

My experience includes developing logistic platforms, managing warehouses, and building e-commerce solutions, all of which have given me a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that small businesses and startups face.

One of my proudest achievements was building and managing the infrastructure for a client, which reduced their costs and ensured efficient operations. I also enjoy fixing UI/UX issues on product and landing pages to increase sales, building monitoring workbooks to measure system performance and errors, and improving website security by setting up gateway rules and regularly updating dependencies.

As a problem solver, I'm always looking for new ways to approach challenges and deliver results for my clients. I believe that clear communication and collaboration are essential to successful projects, and I work hard to build strong relationships with my clients based on trust, respect, and open communication.

I'm also passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends. When I'm not working on projects, you can often find me exploring new tools and techniques, or jogging to clear my mind and stay focused.

In terms of my personality, I'm a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual who takes pride in delivering quality work. I'm dedicated to achieving success for my clients and thrive on tackling complex challenges that others may find daunting.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. If you have any questions or would like to discuss your project further, please don't hesitate to contact me. I look forward to working with you and bringing your ideas to life!
